// THE OUTPUT IS THE FEATURE, so the output is what this file tests.
//
// Almost every step of a bring-up needs a booted VM, and none of the printing
// does. Up therefore takes its VM-facing operations as hooks (upHooks) and its
// destination as an io.Writer, which is what lets the whole ten-step transcript
// — including the two notes that exist to make silent failures visible — be
// asserted here with nothing running.
//
// The same secret rule as config_test.go applies: nothing derived from
// generated material reaches t.Errorf/t.Fatalf except through redact(). The
// fakes below deliberately carry SECRET-SHAPED markers so
// TestUpNeverPrintsSecrets can prove Up does not interpolate any of them.

// The markers are what a leak would look like. They are base64-shaped and long
// enough that redact() covers them too, so even a failure dump of the
// transcript cannot publish them.
// imageTalosVersion is the version the fake ISO reports, and it is
// DELIBERATELY NOT the generator's.
//
// The installer tag is pinned to the IMAGE, and the whole failure that pin
// exists to prevent is Talos substituting the generator's version instead. A
// fixture where the two agree cannot tell the two apart: `TalosVersion:
// GeneratorVersion()` in the wiring produces a byte-identical transcript and
// survives the entire suite. It is older, not newer, so the version guard still
// passes — an older image is exactly what the guard is designed to admit.
